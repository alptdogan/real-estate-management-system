# real-estate-management-system

* Register and login with username: admin and password: admin <br>
* Create clients and then real estates belong to the clients you have created <br>
* You should choose if the property is for sale or to rent <br>
* You should also specify the property's type as house, workplace or land <br>
* You need to specify in which town the property is located. Your options are limited by towns of Yalova City which has an enum class for it <br>
* You can try searching properties by its features such as its number of rooms or type and so on but I can assure you it won't work due to the lack of knowledge I have for front-end development <br>
* Yet you can check swagger screenshots in images folder to see how perfectly (:)) searching worked once <br>
